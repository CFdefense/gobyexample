// In the previous example we used explicit locking with mutexes to synchronize access to shared state across multiple goroutines
// Another option is to use the built-in synchronization features of goroutines and channels to achieve the same result.
// This channel-based approach aligns with Goâ€™s ideas of sharing memory by communicating and having each piece of data owned by exactly 1 goroutine.

// In this example our state will be owned by a single goroutine. This will guarantee that the data is never corrupted with concurrent access.
// In order to read or write that state, other goroutines will send messages to the owning goroutine and receive corresponding replies.
// These readOp and writeOp structs encapsulate those requests and a way for the owning goroutine to respond.
